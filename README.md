# Degrune_et_al_2024

This folder contains the data and R codes to reproduce the data analysis and figures of the paper Degrune et al., 2024 : https://enviromicro-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1462-2920.16673

The **scripts** folder contain all R scripts needed to reproduce the analysis. You should start with **01_dataPreparation.R** and continue with **02_dataAnalysis**.
The unnumbered scripts are imbeded in the two R scripts and will be automatically run with the command source().

The **data** folder contains all files needed to run the analysis in R studio. The files in the data folder are of two types: the **initial** data (in the **initialData** folder) and data resulting from computing steps during the analysis (in the **data** folder). Therefore, if you want to start from scratch, I recommend to only keep the files in the **initialData** folder. The initial data can be found in the original publication *Garland et al., 2021* (see reference below).

The *output* folder contains the figures produced during the analysis (*output/figure*), the output of the random forest modeling (*output/modeling_rf*), the output of the structural equation modeling (*output/modeling_sem*), the output of the spls analysis (*output/modeling_spls*), and the output of the rarefaction curves (*output/rarefaction_curves*). The supplementary material of the mansucript is also provided in the output folder (*output/supplementary_material*)

For the figures, I usually save them as *.svg* and use the free and open source image editor **Inkscape** (version used: 1.0.2) (https://inkscape.org/fr/) to manipulate the image and save it as *.tif* or another format. The *.png* figures are then combined into a global *.xcf* figure using the free and open source image editor **GIMP** (version 2.10) (https://www.gimp.org). The resulted figure is then saved as *.png*. The main figures fig1 and fig2 of the manuscript are provided as *.xcf* files and *.tif* files in the folder *output/figure*. 

For the SEM analysis, the figure was manually created with Inkscape. The values in the figure (pvalue and the coefficient std.lv) are from the output_SEM.csv file located in the output folder > modeling_sem.
